# Angular-Loading-Spinner
Simple loading spinner is added to the host div where this directive is added.

The only other requirement is to add the css animation style that this requires.

You can use this simple keyframes:

@keyframes spinnerAnimation {
  from {transform: rotate(0deg)}
  to {transform: rotate(360deg)}
}
